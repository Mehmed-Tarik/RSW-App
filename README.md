## Reiseziel-St√§dteauswahl (rsw-app)

- The core concept of the rsw-app application is to streamline users' search for the most suitable city or cities for their travel needs. It achieves this by presenting a curated selection of sections, offering a range of options tailored to individual preferences and desired destination experiences. Furthermore, users can calculate an estimated trip cost once they have identified their ideal destination. Presently, the application exclusively features destinations within Germany.

## Usage

- RSW-app offers a user-friendly experience, making it effortless to navigate. On the homepage, a single click on the 'START QUIZ' button initiates the journey. From there, users progress through sections, selecting answers that align with their preferences. At the culmination of the quiz, the app presents the most suitable city based on their selections. Users may also discover multiple city options, each tailored to their tastes. Additionally, they have the option to calculate the trip cost for the chosen city, enhancing the overall experience.
